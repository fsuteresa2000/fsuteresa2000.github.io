Hi, my name is Teresa, and I currently live in Daphne, Alabama with my husband and our two dogs. I have a Bachelors degree in Marketing and an MBA, both from Florida State University - go Noles! I have over 20 years of experience in administration, marketing, and management. For various personal and professional reasons, I have been on what I jokingly refer to as my "nickel-gap." Essentially I have taken a 5 year break from my professional career. I have still kept myself in the mix by providing mentorship and coaching both professionally and personally, as well as reading and studying varied business topics.

That brings me to current day and my decision to pursue a structured learning environment through Bloc. I have always loved computers - our family had one of the first home computers in 1980 - it was an Atari 800. I self-taught myself some basic DOS programming and used that knowledge to win first place in my school's science fair. As I began exploring what the next chapter of my life would look like, I knew I did not want to go back to a 60-hour work week in an office. I wanted something flexible and I wanted it to be something that would challenge me and be fun. After talking to many different developers and programmers, and researching many different options, I felt that Bloc was the best path for me.
